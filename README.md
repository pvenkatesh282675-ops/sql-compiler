## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 1. Requirements
Ensure your host server is running:
- **PHP 8.0+** with PDO/MySQL extensions enabled
- **MariaDB** (10.6+) or native **MySQL**

### 2. Configure the Database
1. Import the stripped schema layout onto your local/development database using the included `unmqwlgl_sql.sql` file. 
2. Open `config/db_control.php` and configure the constants to match your server instance:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_CONTROL_NAME', 'your_db_name');
   define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
   ```

### 3. Setup the AI Fixer & Mail Services
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and generate a free API key.
2. In `includes/AIHelper.php`, replace the placeholder with your key:
   ```php
   $this->apiKey = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'; 
   ```
3. Open `forgot_password.php` and configure the `SimpleSMTP` initiation block with your mail server's credentials.

### 4. Launch
Launch via PHP's built-in webserver. From the project root, simply run:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to begin.
